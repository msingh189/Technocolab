# Hand Gesture Digit Recognition

Count how many fingers are being held up, via a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in Keras + TensorFlow + OpenCV.

The model is able to surpass human perform in the case that the human is severely concussed or inebriated.

Key Requirements: Python 3+, Keras 2+, TensorFlow 1+, OpenCV 2+
